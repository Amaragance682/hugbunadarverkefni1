dtos were just made in cooperation


# Notes for assignment 3

On schedule, most service layer functions are complete, only needing some endpoints for edit requests and obscure alternative scenarios.
That means UC1, UC2, UC3, UC4, UC5, UC6, UC7, UC9 and UC11

Last use cases and testing + fine-tuning will be handled next sprint, and we expect to be able to handle that quite well, seeing the progress made this sprint.

Ragnar has handled code aggregation for the team and have made sure the code is in accordance with the standards we set for outselves, being the P.O. for this sprint.

The project plan has been slightly altered, now including UC11 for user registration and login, seeing as that was missing and only mentioned in a context where it was implied to exist. It can now be accessed in "Project Plan.pdf" in the root folder

# Notes for assignment 4

On schedule, the only thing left to do is to finish UC10, which is an 
easy implementation and should be done before the presentation. 
Functionality for dummy data has been added and advanced shift patching 
and edit request handling has also been completed. For the last week, 
finalizing is the only thing left and stray errors or oversights will 
be ironed out.

UC8 has been removed from the plan, since it did not align with the 
goal of the project in terms of the course, as well as being more 
complicated to implement than we are ready to take on. The updated plan 
can be accessed in Project Plan in the top level of the repository.
