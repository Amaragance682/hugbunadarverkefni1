ragnar:
- Login og user functionality
- Security handling and checks
- JWT stuff
- ShiftService og TaskService mostly

egill:
- db design and architecture
- endpoints so far and basic controller setup

daniel:
- Entities and repos according to db (boilerplate stuff eins og mappers)

oli:
- rest of services (not user-related and shiftservice/taskservice)

dtos were just made in cooperation


# Notes for assignment 3

On schedule, most service layer functions are complete, only needing some endpoints for edit requests and obscure alternative scenarios.
That means UC1, UC2, UC3, UC4, UC5, UC6, UC7, UC9 and UC11

Last use cases and testing + fine-tuning will be handled next sprint, and we expect to be able to handle that quite well, seeing the progress made this sprint.

Ragnar has handled code aggregation for the team and have made sure the code is in accordance with the standards we set for outselves, being the P.O. for this sprint.

The project plan has been slightly altered, now including UC11 for user registration and login, seeing as that was missing and only mentioned in a context where it was implied to exist. It can now be accessed in "Project Plan.pdf" in the root folder
